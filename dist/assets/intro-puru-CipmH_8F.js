I’m a CS student at Arizona State University. I love building full‑stack and AI‑powered projects that make life easier for students and teams.\r
\r
On this site you’ll find short showcases of my projects (Agentic Food, Agentic Book, and an AI dashboard for hospitality), notes on what I’m learning, and a resume that I keep up to date. If something resonates, reach out at [psing176@asu.edu](mailto:psing176@asu.edu).\r
